Note: You will need to override the applicationContext-model-test.xml and feedReaderContext-model-test.xml with the right properties for your datasource
and hibernate config. I will commit these separately, with db credentials removed.

Also, to run these tests using the orale context, they need to be initiated from the oracle extension project. There are two files in the
org.eurekastreams.server package. ClassPathTests provides a way to run all tests in a particular package/path/etc anywhere in the classpath, and 
SingleFileOnClassPathTest enables you to run just a single test. Running the tests without these runners in the eurekastreams-server-oracle application
will make the test run in its default context (no oracle, default db, etc).
